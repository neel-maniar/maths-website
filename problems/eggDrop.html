    <h2>Question</h2>
    <p>You are standing on a \(100\) storey building with \(2\) eggs. These eggs are special: they only break at a certain floor (or higher!). What is the <strong>least</strong> number of drops you need to figure out which floor that is? They may not break on any of the floors!</p>

    <h3>Hint 1</h3>
    <p>You may reuse an unbroken egg</p>

    <h3>Hint 2</h3>
    <p>What if you only had one egg?</p>

    <h3>Hint 3</h3>
    <p>What if you had infinite eggs?</p>

    <h2>Follow-up Question</h2>
    <p>Now suppose you have \(k\) eggs and \(n\) floors: how many drops would you need? You may need a computer for this one. Take a guess for how many drops you need if you have a six-pack of eggs and 1 million floors...</p>

    <p>I first saw it in the Green book, and then saw the follow-up on Leetcode</p>
